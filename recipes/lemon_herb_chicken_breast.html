        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Make the marinade:</strong> To make sure chicken breast is juicy and delicious, make sure to marinade them in a punchy, herb-filled marinade for at least 20 minutes but up to a few hours. Be careful with marinades containing citrus as they can break down the proteins too much and make the chicken gummy. You can also freeze them in the marinade to speed up meal prep. Combine olive oil, lemon juice, paprika, mixed dried herbs, fresh thyme, lemon zest and garlic.</li>
            <li> <strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> Place the skinless, boneless chicken breasts in between two layers of parchment/baking paper and flatten them out slightly with a meat mallet or rolling pin. By doing this you are making sure the chicken is all one thickness and you’re also tenderizing the meat slightly. Place the chicken in a glass container and pour over the marinade. Cover and marinate for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Cook the chicken in a skillet, pan or griddle pan set over high heat for 3-5 minutes per side (depending on thickness) until cooked through. Allow the chicken to rest for at least 5 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute in the meat before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
