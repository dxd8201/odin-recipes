            This Cajun crawfish etouffee recipe is loaded with meaty crawfish tails smothered in a rich gravy with spices and fresh herbs, served over rice. It's huge on flavor and easy to make. One of our very favorites!</p>

            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>Cajun seasonings</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Salt and black bepper</li>
            <li>Stock</li>
            <li>Crawfish tails</li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the Roux. Heat a large pan or pot to medium heat and melt the butter. Add the flour and stir to make a roux. Stir constantly for 5 minutes, or until the roux turns a copper color. Do not let the roux burn. A Dutch oven is great for making etouffee.</li>
            <li>Cook the Vegetables. Add the onion, bell peppers, celery and garlic. Stir and cook for 5 minutes to soften.</li>
            <li>Stock, Seasonings, Simmer. Stir in the Cajun seasonings, cayenne, salt and pepper to taste, and stock or broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to let the flavors develop. I like to simmer 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crawfish and Parsley. Add the crawfish tails and warm them through. Remove from heat and stir in the parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve the Etouffee. Serve over white rice (if desired) and garnish with extra parsley and spicy chili flakes.</li>
        </ol>
